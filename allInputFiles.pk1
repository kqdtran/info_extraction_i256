aS'  THESE DEMANDS ARE RELATED TO THE STRUGGLE AGAINST REPRESSION, THE DEFENSE OF HUMAN RIGHTS, THE DENUNCIATION OF CRIMES COMMITTED BY THE REGIME, AND EFFORTS TO FIGHT IMMUNITY AND THE SUPPRESSION OF THE TRUTH REGARDING TORTURE, DISAPPEARANCES, AND ASSASSINATIONS'
p3925

aS'  [BEGIN RECORDING] [INZUNZA] THE IDEA IS TO INVOLVE THE MILITARY INSTITUTION IN CRIMES FOR WHICH THE CHILEAN PEOPLE KNOWS IT WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE'

aS'  THROUGHOUT THE AMERICAS, DEMOCRACY IS THE PATH AND THAT IS WHY IT WILL BE THE ADEQUATE MEANS FOR STRENGTHENING THE OAS AS A REGIONAL ORGANIZATION IN WHICH THE VARIOUS TRENDS AND IDEOLOGIES WITHIN A COMMON OBJECTIVE OF SEARCHING FOR PEACE, FREEDOM, LIBERTY, AND JUSTICE MAY AND SHOULD BE EXPRESSED AND CONSULTED ON'

p6044
aS'  ALL OF THESE ARE TOPICS WE HAVE DISCUSSED OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS WITH OUR RESPECTIVE TEAMS'
p6045
aS'  HOWEVER, THERE IS ONE TOPIC THAT I WISH TO EMPHASIZE'
p6046
aS'  THERE IS AN ENEMY WHO SEEKS TO DESTROY THE INTEGRATIONIST AND DEMOCRATIC PROJECT'
p6047
aS'  THERE ARE ANACHRONISTIC REDOUBTS OF A SUBVERSIVE NATURE THAT ARE TODAY ENFENCED BY OUR MILITARY FORCES AND OUR HARD WORKING PEOPLE'
p6048
aS'  THE ENEMY FEELS HIS DAYS ARE NUMBERED AND HE EXPRESSES HIMSELF THOUGH VIOLENT ACTIONS WITH KIDNAPPINGS, EXTORTION, AND INDISCRIMINATE TERRORISM; BY DESTROYING OIL PIPELINES AND CONTAMINATING RIVERS, WATER BASINS, AND LAGOONS'
p6049
aS'  OUR COMMISSIONS HAVE SUGGESTED POSITIVE MEANS FOR WORKING JOINTLY ON THESE RIVERS, WATER BASINS, AND LAGOONS, AND HAVE SIGNED AN AGREEMENT THAT IS ALREADY BEING IMPLEMENTED ON OIL SPILLS AND ACCIDENTS'
p6050
aS'  COLOMBIAN DEMOCRACY WILL PREVAIL OVER THIS INTERNAL ENEMY, AND UNDOUBTEDLY THE INTEGRATION PROGRAMS WILL CONTINUE WITH RENEWED VIGOR'
p6051
aS' THE TECHNICAL MANAGEMENT OF THE WATER RESOUCES, THE ELECTRICITY AND TELEPHONE INTERCONNECTIONS, THE FEASIBILITY STUDIES FOR THE VARIOUS ALTERNATE ROUTES THAT WILL CONNECT US, THE REOPENING OF THE BRIDGES THAT WERE CLOSED 30 YEARS AGO, THE UTILIZATION OF THE CAMILO DAZA AIRPORT IN CUCUTA AS AN ALTERNATE AIRPORT FOR SAN ANTONIO, THE AGREEMENT ON FISHING POLICIES, THE PLANS TO INCREASE CROPS RANGING FROM SUGARCANE AND COTTON TO CHIQUI-CHIQUI FIBER ARE POSITIVE ANSWERS TO THOSE WHO INSIST ON DISRUPTING THINGS'
p6052
aS"  THE INTERNATIONAL POLICY TODAY NOT ONLY UNDERSTANDS THE TRADITIONAL CONCEPT AND THE PRESERVATION OF NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY, BUT ABOVE ALL, IT POINTS TO PEOPLE'S WELL-BEING AND INCREASES THEIR CAPABILITIES FOR CONSUMPTION"
p6053
aS"  IT IS NOT BY BLOWING UP OIL PIPELINES OR PREVENTING THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE ALONG THE RIVER BANKS OF BOTH COUNTRIES FROM FISHING OR BY POISONING THEIR CROPS THAT PEOPLE'S WELL-BEING WILL BE ACHIEVED"
p6054
aS'  I AM SURE THAT THE SAN PEDRO ALEJANDRINO DOCUMENT WE SIGNED TODAY IS A GRADUAL, BUT DECISIVE STEP TOWARD AUTHENTIC LATIN AMERICAN INTEGRATION'
p6055
aS'  BY THE DECISION OF THEIR PEOPLE AND PROMOTED BY THEIR RULERS IN THIS SIMPLE ROOM WHERE THE LIBERATOR DIED, WE ARE TODAY CONSOLIDATING THESE BASES THAT WILL NOT BE DESTROYED AND WILL PREVENT IN THE FUTURE ANY FURTHER FRUSTRATIONS OF THE DREAMS OF THE LIBERATOR, BOLIVAR'
p6056
aS'  MIXED COMMISSIONS WILL BE APPOINTED SHORTLY AND WILL GET DOWN TO WORK IN WHAT WE STILL HAVE YET TO DO'

aS'  HOWEVER, TONIGHT ALLOW ME TO GIVE YOU TWO EXAMPLES OF WHAT WE CONSIDER SHOULD BE THE USE OF THE WORD SOLIDARITY AND WHAT THIS WORD MEANS IN MATTERS THAT ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER'
p6198
aS'  A FEW WEEKS AGO THE GOVERNMENT WAS FORCED, DUE TO AN INCREASE IN OIL PRICES, TO RAISE THE PRICE OF OIL BYPRODUCTS SUCH AS GASOLINE, DIESEL, AND ALL FUELS'
p6199
aS'  IN THE PAST, THE GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIZED GASOLINE'

aS' THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT PRICES WILL RISE WHEN A GOVERNMENT SPENDS MORE THAN WHAT IT HAS'

p6205
aS'  TEN PERCENT OF ALL FAMILIES IN OUR COUNTRY OWN A VEHICLE'
p6206
aS'  IN GENERAL, THAT 10 PERCENT ARE THOSE WHO HAVE THE MOST; IN OTHER WORDS, THOSE WHO HAVE THE POSSIBILITY OF BUYING A CAR, A VEHICLE'
p6207
aS'  IF WE SUBSIDIZED GASOLINE, WHAT WE WOULD BE DOING IS TAKING MONEY OUT OF A GOVERNMENT THAT, FOR THE TIME BEING, DOES NOT HAVE SUCH FUNDS AVAILABLE'
p6208
aS'  IN ORDER TO GET SUCH FUNDS, THE GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE TO IMPOSE NEW TAXES WHICH WOULD AFFECT ALL SALVADORANS'
p6209
aS'  THEREFORE, LET US THINK WHETHER OR NOT IT IS FAIR THAT 90 PERCENT OF ALL SALVADORAN FAMILIES, WHO OWN NO VEHICLES, MUST PAY SOME KIND OF TAX IN ORDER TO BENEFIT THE OTHER 10 PERCENT WHO HAVE THE RESOURCES THAT ALLOW THEM TO BUY A VEHICLE'
p6210
aS'  WE DO NOT WANT TO APPEAR AS DEMAGOGIC OR POPULIST WITH THIS EXAMPLE'
p6211
aS'  WHAT WE WANT TO SAY IS THAT THOSE OF US WHO OWN A VEHICLE, WHO ARE PART OF THE 10 PERCENT LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE SOMETHING AND THUS CAN BUY A VEHICLE, MUST BE IN SOLIDARITY WITH THAT 90 PERCENT WHO HAVE LITTLE AND MANY TIMES NOTHING'
p6212
aS'  THEY HAVE NO VEHICLES, AND THEREFORE HAVE NO REASON TO SUFFER SO THE GASOLINE WE BUY BECOMES CHEAPER'
p6213
aS' MOREOVER, TO SOME EXTENT THE CURRENT PRICE OF GASOLINE MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR THE DIESEL SUPPLIED TO URBAN AND INTERURBAN BUS COMPANIES TO BE BOUGHT AT A PRICE THAT WILL ALLOW BUS OWNERS TO MAINTAIN THE CURRENT BUS FARES'
p6214
aS'  THIS IS SOLIDARITY, AND EVEN MORE THAN THAT'
p6215
aS' THOSE OF US WHO HAVE SOMETHING, WHO OWN A VEHICLE, PAY SOMETHING -- THROUGH THE PRICE OF THE GASOLINE WE CONSUME -- SO THAT THOSE WHO OWN NOTHING AND MUST USE THE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION BUSES CAN DO SO WITH NO PRICE INCREASE'
p6216
aS'  THE SAME SHOULD BE THE CASE FOR THE COST OF LIQUID GAS AND PROPANE GAS, SO THAT THE PRICES OF FOOD COOKED WITH GAS IN THE MARKETPLACES ARE NOT INCREASED'
p6217
aS'  THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THOSE OF US WHO HAVE SOMETHING CAN SHOW OUR SOLIDARITY WITH THOSE WHO HAVE LITTLE OR NOTHING AT ALL'

p6419
aS'  SECOND, THERE IS MISINFORMATION AND ALARMISM REGARDING THE MATTER'
p6420
aS'  WHAT IS THE IMF?  IT IS SOME SORT OF CREDITOR BANK CREATED IN 1946 THAT LENDS MONEY TO COUNTRIES WITH BALANCE-OF-PAYMENTS PROBLEMS; THAT IS, WITH PROBLEMS WITH THEIR FOREIGN RESERVES LEVELS'
p6421
aS'  WHEN A COUNTRY HAS NO RESERVES OR ONLY $100 MILLION IN RESERVES, IT CAN APPLY FOR A CREDIT FROM THE IMF TO PAY FOR IMPORTS OR OVERDUE DEBTS'

aS'  THIS IS THE IMF, AN ORGANIZATION CREATED TO FACILITATE THE FLOW OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL RESOURCES'
p6423
aS'  AN IMF CREDIT IS DEPENDENT ON SIGNING A LETTER OF INTENT OR AN ADJUSTMENT PROGRAM'

p6469
aS'  ACCORDING TO CRISTIANI, THE NEW FMLN PROPOSAL IS "PROPAGANDIST" AND IS ONLY MEANT TO GAIN SOME TIME IN VIEW OF THE "MILITARY DEFEAT SUFFERED IN THE LAST FEW DAYS'
p6470
aS'"  CRISTIANI SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS WILLING TO SEEK A RATIONAL SOLUTION TO THE MILITARY CONFLICT IN THIS COUNTRY, BUT HE CATEGORICALLY EMPHASIZED THAT THIS MEANS THAT THE GUERRILLAS MUST LAY DOWN THEIR WEAPONS AND JOIN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS'
p6471
aS'  "WE WILL NOT ALLOW THE GUERRILLAS TO REGROUP AND BEGIN ATTACKING AGAIN'
p6472
aS'  IF THEY WANT TO HOLD A DIALOGUE, THEY SHOULD LAY DOWN THEIR WEAPONS AND PEACEFULLY JOIN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS," CRISTIANI SAID'

aS'  THE PRESIDENT WARNED THAT "THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMED FORCES ARE WILLING TO FIGHT MILITARILY'

p6476
aS'  FOLLOWING THE FIRST BOMBINGS, WHICH ROCKED THE MILITARY OFFICES WHERE THE NEWS CONFERENCE WAS BEING HELD, CRISTIANI AND PONCE RESUMED CONTROL OF THE CONFERENCE AND EXPLAINED THAT THE ATTACK WAS THE RESULT OF AN OPERATION IN PURSUIT OF THE "GUERRILLAS FLEEING IN DISARRAY'
p6477
aS'"  THE AIR FORCE BOMBING BEGAN SHORTLY BEFORE THE CURFEW, WHICH BEGAN AT 1800 (0000 GMT) UNTIL 0600 IN THE MORNING (1200 GMT), JUST WHEN THOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS WERE RETURNING HOME'

p6480
aS'  THE PROPOSAL SIGNED BY THE TOP FIVE FMLN COMMANDERS AND READ ON THE OFFICIAL REBEL STATION, CLANDESTINE RADIO VENCEREMOS, HAS BEEN RELEASED IN THE FRAMEWORK OF A REBEL MILITARY OFFENSIVE, WHICH BEGAN 12 DAYS AGO AND WHICH HAS LEFT MORE THAN 1,000 PEOPLE DEAD, HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WOUNDED, AND TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HOMELESS'

p6531
aS'  CRISTIANI SAYS THAT SINCE 1 JUNE HE HAS REPEATEDLY CALLED FOR A PEACE DIALOGUE, ADDING:  "IN ORDER TO BEGIN A DIALOGUE OF THIS NATURE, IT MUST BE HELD IN TWO PHASES:  NATURALLY, DURING THE FIRST PHASE BOTH SIDES MUST SIT DOWN TO DISCUSS THE MECHANISMS TO DEVELOP THAT DIALOGUE PROCESS, A TIMETABLE FOR THE TALKS, AND THE PLACE WHERE THE TALKS WILL BE HELD'

p6542
aS'  WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN ELIMINATE PRICE CONTROLS ON 230 PRODUCTS WITHOUT HAVING A MAJOR IMPACT ON THE MAJORITY OF THE PUBLIC AND THAT WE CAN KEEP STAPLE PRODUCTS UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE ECONOMY MINISTRY'
p6543
aS'"  HE SAYS THAT PRICE CONTROLS ON STAPLES LIKE BASIC GRAINS, POWDERED MILK, FLOUR, COFFEE, SUGAR, VEGETABLE OIL AND LARD, CEMENT FOR HOUSING, AND OIL BY-PRODUCTS WILL NOT BE ELIMINATED'
p6544
aS'  REGARDING THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR, CRISTIANI SAYS: "WE AGREED WITH THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR TO DEREGULATE THE DIFFERENTIAL SERVICE'
p6545
aS' TO ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE SERVING LOW-INCOME SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION WHILE CHARGING CURRENT FARES, WE WILL ALSO ALLOW THEM TO OFFER THE HIGHER-PRICED SERVICE'
p6546

p6547
aS'"  ON ELECTRICITY RATES, CRISTIANI SAYS: "WE FEEL THAT ADJUSTMENTS TO ELECTRICITY RATES SHOULD BE APPLIED AS A RESULT OF POWER THAT IS WASTED, THAT IS, BECAUSE IT IS POWER THAT IS BEING CONSUMED BEYOND WHAT IS NEEDED TO LIVE NORMALLY'
p6548
aS'  THE INCREASE IN ELECTRICITY RATES WILL BE DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL TO THE CONSUMPTION OF ENERGY IN EACH HOME'
p6549
aS'  WE BELIEVE THAT WITH THIS INITIAL MEASURE, THE CEL [LEMPA RIVER HYDROELECTRIC EXECUTIVE COMMISSION] SOLVE PROBLEMS'
p6550
aS'"  TURNING TO OTHER ECONOMIC MEASURES, CRISTIANI SAYS:  "WE HAVE TO TAKE SHORT-TERM MEASURES TOO'
p6551
aS'  IN THIS RESPECT, THE MOST LOGICAL STEP IS TO TAKE MEASURES THAT WILL AFFECT CONSUMPTION AND NOT REVENUES'
p6552
aS' THUS, WE HAVE ASKED THE FINANCE MINISTER TO TAKE MEASURES RELATED TO TAXES'

aS'  HE IS TO CONSOLIDATE TAX PAYMENTS AND ONLY EXEMPT THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED BASIC BREAD BASKET ITEMS FROM THE PRESENT 5-PERCENT TAX'

aS"  HE SAYS THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO MAKE INTEREST RECEIVED ON SAVINGS ACCOUNTS IN THE COUNTRY'S BANKS MORE ATTRACTIVE SO THAT CAPITAL DOES NOT LEAVE THE COUNTRY"
